# nix-term-dimensions

A utility to fetch the dimensions of the terminal it is run in.
Works on both `Linux/x86-64` and `MacOS/AArch64`. Other Unixen
may or may not work, but are definitely not supported.

# Usage

Execute `nix-term-dimensions --columns --rows` to query both
the width (in columns) and the height (in rows).
